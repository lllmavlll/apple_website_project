# apple_website_project
As my intrest on creating website as a project went high and high, i always wanted create a website which is as good as the Official apple website. I gave a try on this and it came out pretty good and looks good than expected. And I'm satisfied with my work. 

Here in this project I've used only HTML and CSS. I haven't used any javascript for now, but in the future i will work on some features like the button your orders and few more using javascript. And it took me around 3 days to complete this, till the CSS part.
